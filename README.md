## Project Description:
- The interface of this app offers the potential for an individual to virtually navigate any city, landmark, or destination that piques their interest. This attends to the interactivity and encouragement of citizens to explore their surrounding environment. With this app, this will allow the user to engage in their environment curiosity and do so with comfortability and ease.

## Problem Domain:
- Nowadays our current environment encourages the practice of the home-body mentality. The pandemic has further pushed that agenda and for a while our community boundaries were confined in a single living space. Shifting that stay-at-home mentality from where we were only a few years ago is more difficult than any of us could've imagined. We seek to aleviate that with this app, that allows the user to explore what's around them.
